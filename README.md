# Horvath Donat [Hordon13]

Hi there! In this repository you can see how a caterpillar could become a butterfly, or in other words, how a total noob student of humanities could become a junior programmer. Literally step-by-step, since this repo is kind of a code-journal where you can see every single line of code I wrote since day 1 at Green Fox Academy's bootcamp.

## Technologies I used...

* at my previous studies:
	* Praat scripts - It is a powerful tool for phonetics
	* A little MatLab, R and Python
	* Basic HTML, CSS and WordPress
* at GreenFox Academy (so far):
	* C++

## More about me in a few words...

* Started as a Pharmacy Student @SOTE
* Continued as a Teacher Candidate in Chemistry, Hungrian Language and Literature @ELTE
* Graduated as an Applied Linguist (BA) @ELTE
* Currently graduating as a Speech Scientis (MA) @ ELTE
* Worked as a journalist for about 2 and a half years.
* Also worked a bit as a linguist in smaller, short-term projects like:
	* localizing a software product for What3Words,
	* developing forensic automatic speaker recognition systems for the Special Service for National Security.
* I still have a strong interest in Speech Science, I would be more than happy to use my new programming skills and my previously gained lingistic knowledge in projects.
